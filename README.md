# Personal Project: Application for Connecting Grinnellians Tutors

This app is a personal project in progress.  

The idea is to have an online, central hub for the tutors working with Connecting Grinnellians (Grinnell College student group) to log their tutoring hours and check their training requirements.  This project was a great hands-on tool to learn about mobile applications, asynchronous code, ID tokens, and much more involving Java, Android Studio, and Google's Firebase.
