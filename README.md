# CGApp: Application for Connecting Grinnellians Tutors

This app is a personal project in progress.  

Ideally, it would be a hub for the tutors working with Connecting Grinnellians (Grinnell College student group)to log their tutoring hours and check their training requirements.  A central database would make the administration of the group much simpler.
