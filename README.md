# CGApp: Application for Connecting Grinnellians Tutors

This app is a personal project in progress.  If completed, it would be a hub for tutors working with Connecting Grinnellians (Grinnell College student group) to log their tutoring hours and check their training requirements.  This would make adminstrating the group of tutors a simple task for Connecting Grinnellians leadership.

Because of changes in Connecting Grinnellians' leadership structure, the app would no longer be beneficial, but everything I have learned and written will remain here.
