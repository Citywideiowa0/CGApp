# Personal Project: Application for Connecting Grinnellians Tutors

This app is a personal project in progress.  

The idea is to have an online, central hub for the tutors working with Connecting Grinnellians (Grinnell College student group) to log their tutoring hours and check their training requirements.  While the app would not be beneficial to Connecting Grinnellians anymore, because of changes in the group's leadership model, this project was a great hands-on tool to learn about mobile applications, asynchronous code, ID tokens, and much more involving Javva, Android Studio, and Google's Firebase.
